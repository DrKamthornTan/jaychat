Introduction

Group Life and Group Medical Insurance are essential part of fringe benefits in addition to the
workman compensation and social security benefits. We believe that your organization recognizes the
importance of human resources as a crucial key factor to support the stability and progression of your

benefits handbook for your employees to study our benefits, coverage, exclusions, operations and
claims process and Group Privilege Card utilization.
